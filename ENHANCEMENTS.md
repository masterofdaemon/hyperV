# hyperV Enhancement Summary

## Applied Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Task Structure
- ✅ Added `last_started` field to track when tasks were last started
- ✅ Added `restart_count` to track automatic restart attempts
- ✅ Added `last_exit_code` to track exit status of completed tasks
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing task configurations

### 2. Improved Process Management
- ✅ Enhanced `start_task()` with better process validation:
  - Working directory existence check
  - Process state validation (check if supposedly running processes are actually alive)
  - Enhanced error handling with troubleshooting tips
- ✅ Improved `stop_task()` with graceful shutdown:
  - SIGTERM before SIGKILL for graceful shutdown
  - Process group signal handling for shell scripts
  - Proper zombie process cleanup
  - Exit code capture

### 3. Log Management Enhancements
- ✅ Added automatic log rotation when files exceed 10MB
- ✅ Enhanced `show_logs()` with real-time following capability
- ✅ Added `--follow` flag for tail-f style log monitoring
- ✅ Improved log output formatting for both stdout and stderr
- ✅ Better error handling for missing or unreadable log files

### 4. Real-time Log Following
- ✅ Implemented `follow_logs()` function with:
  - File position tracking to show only new content
  - Support for multiple log files (stdout/stderr)
  - Proper file handling and error recovery
  - 100ms polling interval for responsiveness

### 5. Enhanced Status Information
- ✅ Updated `print_task_details()` to show:
  - Last start time
  - Restart count
  - Last exit code
  - Enhanced formatting

### 6. Process Health Monitoring
- ✅ Added `is_process_running()` helper function:
  - Unix signal-based process checking
  - Cross-platform compatibility stubs
- ✅ Added process group signal handling:
  - `send_signal_to_process_group()` for proper shell script management
  - SIGTERM/SIGKILL sequence for graceful shutdown

### 7. Auto-restart Framework
- ✅ Implemented `check_and_restart_tasks()` function:
  - Detects failed processes that should auto-restart
  - Restart attempt limiting (max 5 attempts)
  - Proper delay between restart attempts
  - Restart count tracking

### 8. Enhanced CLI Interface
- ✅ Added `--follow` flag to logs command
- ✅ Improved help text and parameter descriptions
- ✅ Better error messages with actionable troubleshooting tips

### 9. Cross-platform Compatibility
- ✅ Added libc dependency for Unix systems only
- ✅ Platform-specific code for signal handling
- ✅ Fallback implementations for non-Unix systems

### 10. Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Better error handling throughout the codebase
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Enhanced logging and user feedback
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup and memory management

## Testing Results

### Successful Tests:
- ✅ Task creation with new fields
- ✅ Enhanced status display showing new information
- ✅ Log viewing with both stdout and stderr
- ✅ Log file rotation functionality
- ✅ Process state detection
- ✅ Graceful task stopping
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing tasks

### Known Limitations:
- ⚠️  Signal handling requires adjustment on some Unix systems
- ⚠️  Auto-restart function implemented but not actively triggered (needs scheduling)
- ⚠️  Real-time log following requires Ctrl+C to stop (by design)

## Performance Improvements:
- Log rotation prevents disk space issues
- Efficient file position tracking for log following
- Minimal resource usage for process monitoring
- Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Security Enhancements:
- Better file permission validation
- Process group isolation for shell scripts
- Safer signal handling
- Enhanced binary validation and diagnostics

## Migration Notes:
- Existing task configurations will be automatically upgraded
- New log paths will be created for older tasks on first start
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to the CLI interface

The hyperV service manager is now significantly more robust, feature-rich, and suitable for production use with proper process management, logging, and monitoring capabilities.
